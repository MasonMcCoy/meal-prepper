## Description
Everyone wants an evening in, whether it be by themselves or with friends. With the Homebuddy app you can make that evening in just as memorable as an evening out! With Homebuddy you can select a specific recipe to cook, or search with a general search-term if you're feeling indecisive! There's also the option to save a recipe for later to your "Saved Recipes" page, whether you already made it and loved it or you want to try it later. After selecting a recipe for your evening in, select a movie to pair with your meal! You can search for your movie-of-choice by genre as well as title or keyword. Both your dinner and movie selections will be displayed at the conclusion of the app, and your Homebuddy evening in can begin!
